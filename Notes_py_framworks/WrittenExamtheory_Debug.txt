1. What is the difference between 'is' and '=='' in Python?
'is' checks for identity (same memory), '==' checks for equality in value.
Example:
a = [1,2]; b = a; c = [1,2]
a is b True, a == c True, a is c False


2. Differentiate between list, tuple, and dictionary.
List: mutable, ordered.
Tuple: immutable, ordered.
Dict: key-value pairs, unordered (Python 3.6+ insertion ordered).


3. What is the use of lambda functions? Give one example.
Lambda is an anonymous function used for short, inline functions.
Example: square = lambda x: x*x


4. Explain loc[] vs iloc[] in pandas with example.
loc[]: label-based indexing.
iloc[]: integer-based indexing.
Example: df.loc[0, 'name'] vs df.iloc[0, 1]


5. How do you handle missing values in pandas?
Use isnull(), fillna(), dropna().
Example: df.fillna(0), df.dropna(), df.isnull().sum()


6. What is the output of this code? Why?

x = [1, 2, 3]
y = x
y[0] = 100
print(x)
Output: [100, 2, 3]
Because y is a reference to x; changing y[0] also changes x.


7. Explain try-except block in Python with an example for ZeroDivisionError.
try:
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
print(a/b)
except ZeroDivisionError:
print('Cannot divide by zero.')


8. What is groupby() used for in pandas?
groupby() is used to split data into groups based on a column and perform aggregate functions like
sum, mean.

9. How to merge two DataFrames and fill missing values?
Use pd.merge(df1, df2, how='outer').fillna(0) to merge and fill NaNs.


10. What are the differences between apply(), map(), and lambda?
apply(): applies a function along axis.
map(): works on Series.
lambda: used with both.
Example: df['col'].apply(lambda x: x+1)


11. Explain the use of heatmap, boxplot, and pairplot in seaborn.
heatmap: show correlation, boxplot: distribution with outliers, pairplot: all variable
relationships (esp. for classification).


12. What are the advantages of NumPy arrays over Python lists?
NumPy arrays are faster, memory-efficient, and support broadcasting and vectorized operations.


13. How to create and reshape a NumPy array? Write a code snippet.
arr = np.arange(12).reshape(3, 4) creates 3x4 matrix from numbers 011.


14. Why do we use virtual environments in Python for Data Science?
Virtual environments allow isolated project-specific dependencies, preventing conflicts.


15. What is vectorization in NumPy? Why is it important?
Vectorization allows applying operations on entire arrays instead of loops. It's faster and
concise. Example: arr + 1
